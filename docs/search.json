    "text": "Well, sort of. I used it a ton in version 1.0 and then eventually stopped. Then I used it again a ton when version 2 came out, and then eventually stopped. It worked well when I really forced myself to use it, but eventually I’d run out of gas, and it always bugged me a bit that I couldn’t get a handle on why. I read David Allen’s “Getting Things Done”, which it was inspired by, and it all made sense, but it still just had a lot of friction to keep using.\nOne of the problems, I now realize, was the notion of contexts - each to-do item could be assigned to one, and only one, context, like “online” or “supermarket” or “home”, describing the setting where a task could be done. The problem was that there were many tasks that could be done in multiple contexts, but no way to mark them as such. One user I talked with on one of the forums explained that the way to think about it was that I myself could be in multiple simultaneous contexts, like “home” and “online”, and that tasks that matched either of those would appear. It sort of made sense, but it still never felt natural and I eventually dropped it again.\nI checked it out again in version 3, and the problem has been solved: contexts are gone, replaced by the much more versatile and familiar concept of tags. Tags can be freely defined, and any item can have as many tags as you want. So now I’m using it again and finding it much easier to get along with.\n(I also really appreciate that there is the option to just pay for it straight up, though they also offer the odious subscription-based pricing that everybody except developers hates. There is upgrade pricing from prior versions that makes it more affordable. They also offer educational pricing, so between my educational pricing and upgrade discount, OF3 went from $99 to about $38. Sold.)\nIt’s full of really nice little interface touches that are almost invisible but that make life very pleasant. One of them is the ability to import tasks in TaskPaper format, which is very straightforward. I needed to add a list of 24 assignments (sigh) to my inbox, one per day for the next 24 days. I had them typed out, and with the help of a few emacs macros added due dates and tags, using the following format:\n- task description @tags(tag1, tag2) @due(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)\nSo my full list was:\n- (ch 3) Simple linear regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-02 23:59)\n- (ch 3) Multiple linear regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-03 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Logistic regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-04 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Multiple logistic regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-05 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Linear discriminant analysis @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-06 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Quadratic discriminant analysis @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-07 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Naive Bayes @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-08 23:59)\n- (ch 4) K-Nearest Neighbors @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-09 23:59)\n- (ch 4) Poisson regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-10 23:59)\n- (ch 5) Cross-validation @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-11 23:59)\n- (ch 5) Bootstrap @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-12 23:59)\n- (ch 6) Best subset selection @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-13 23:59)\n- (ch 6) Stepwise selection @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-14 23:59)\n- (ch 6) Ridge regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-15 23:59)\n- (ch 6) Lasso @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-16 23:59)\n- (ch 6) Principal component regression @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-17 23:59)\n- (ch 8) Bagging @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-18 23:59)\n- (ch 8) Random forests @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-19 23:59)\n- (ch 8) Boosting @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-20 23:59)\n- (ch 8) Bayesian Additive Regression Trees @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-21 23:59)\n- (ch 9) Support Vector Machines @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-22 23:59)\n- (ch 12) Principal component analysis @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-23 23:59)\n- (ch 12) K-means clustering @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-24 23:59)\n- (ch 12) Hierarchical clustering @tags(Machine Learning, Homework) @due(2022-04-25 23:59)\nCopy the entire list, and then just paste into the inbox, and voilà:\n\n\n\nInbox\n\n\nNow the problem is I have to actually do all of those things.

    "text": "Creating a (this) blog post\nSo one immediate difference in terms of workflow is that the Quarto CLI doesn’t have - as of version 1.1.251, anyway - commands for creating blog post files. In Distill, you would say create_post(\"Foo\") in the RStudio console, and that would create a skeleton with some base infrastructure, some automatic date-fu, etc. It would be easy enough to build a quick utility for doing this, but I kind of like that a blog post appears to just be a file (OK, a directory with an index.qmd file) inside the top-level posts directory.\nSo I’m going to save this file in the path posts/2022-10-01_distill_to_quarto_part_1/index.qmd, and that’s all that’s needed to make it a blog post. Yes, I’m typing out the date and title by hand, which is slightly more tedious than Distill, but I also know there’s nothing special going on under the hood when I add this file.\nWhy name the folder …distill_to_quarto_part_1 instead of just distill_to_quarto? Because I’m pretty sure I read somewhere that there’s a context where blog post titles can be disambiguated from their date prefixes, and so I want the title to be unique enough to withstand that if I add another similarly-titled post in the future. Not feeling super confident about this decision so far, but there it is.\n(See That pesky first image in Appendix A below for the first snag: the first, or “listing”, image, and a pathname problem in Quarto.)"

Each document’s (or post’s) title is rendered as an h1 tag above the body, but you need to have at least one h2 tag for the table of contents to appear.\nTo make this work in the posts directory (or presumably any directory), it needs to be specified in the directory’s _metadata.yml file (so in this case, posts/_metadata.yml) like this:\n# Default for table of contents\ntoc: true\ntoc-title: Table of contents\ntoc-location: left\nI believe that was there by default; it could be moved over to the right if you wanted something else in the left margin, like a site directory or something.\n\nGithub links\nAt least in the default configuration, this is also where your github links configured for this specific page will appear. Unfortunately, that means they won’t appear if your document lacks h2 tags, and consequently the table of contents isn’t built. I’d prefer to have these links appear regardless, and separate from the table of contents; putting that on my mental list of things to figure out."

Quarto is built on Bootstrap 5 (at present), which means we get yummy candy like that for free:\n:::{.callout-important}\nNote: if you're...\n:::\nAnyway, now we’ve got the directory for a single Distill post copied into the Quarto posts directory, and we need to convert it so Quarto will render it. What do we need to do?\n\n1. Delete the extraneous files\nHere’s what we’ve got:\n\nThis will vary a bit by post content, but of these, the two we want are the .Rmd file, which is the original blog post content from Distill, and the supporting png image. The .html file can go, and the …_files directory (full of Javascript files) can go.\nThen we rename the .Rmd file to index.qmd, and we have this:\n\n\n\n2. Update the post’s YAML header\nThe old YAML header for the Distill blog looks like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Quickie for importing tasks to OmniFocus 3\"\ndescription: |\n  Copy and paste formatted text to mass-create tasks.\nauthor:\n  - name: Steve Linberg\n    url: https://slinberg.net\ndate: 2022-04-02\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\npreview: https://www.omnigroup.com/assets/img/icons/omnifocus-web@2x.png\ncategories:\n  - omnifocus\n---\nSome of this will work in Quarto, some stuff has to be changed or removed. The current, very simple header for this post is:\ntitle: \"Porting slinberg.net from Distill to Quarto\"\ndate: \"2022-10-01\"\ncategories: [quarto, distill, blog]\nimage: quarto.png\nSo we can keep title and date in the original header. I don’t remember why the optional description attribute led with a vertical bar and a newline; the author tag can be deleted, as it will inherit the default values from posts/_metadata.yml; the output section can be deleted, the preview attribute can get quoted and renamed to image, and the categories tag gets pulled up to a single line, a square-bracketed list of categories. I’m adding “blog” as a category to blog posts, so far, since it will give another option for filtering blog posts as separate from static content on the site; not totally sure this will be needed, but going with it for the moment.\nThe updated YAML header now looks like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Quickie for importing tasks to OmniFocus 3\"\ndescription: \"Copy and paste formatted text to mass-create tasks.\"\ndate: \"2022-04-02\"\nimage: \"https://www.omnigroup.com/assets/img/icons/omnifocus-web@2x.png\"\ncategories: [blog, omnifocus]\n---\nThe description attribute, if present, will be used instead of a content preview on the listing page.\n\n\n3. Nuke the knitr setup block\n(For the life of me, I cannot remember, figure out, or google how to quote markdown within markdown, so to make this render I’m changing the backticks to single-quotes:)\n'''{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)\n'''\nDelete that block, and any other extraneous knitr stuff unless you know why you need it.\nSave and render. For this post, we’re done; it’s in and looks good. The blog page now looks like this:\n\n\n\n4. Commit!\nDon’t forget: commit early, commit often:\ngit add posts/2022-04-02-quickie-for-importing-tasks-to-omnifocus-3/\ngit commit -m \"migrate old post\"\n\n\n5. Rinse and repeat\nNow, do the same process with the rest of the posts. I don’t have that many to move, so doing it manually isn’t too tedious, but it could be scripted for a lot of content if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: by not renaming the post directory, and by virtue of the fact that both Distill and Quarto use /posts as the top level for blog posts by default, the URLs for the posts won’t change when we switch. It’s rude to break your working URLs when migrating (even though the number of humans who correctly care about this is vanishingly small), so this is good news. If your posts directory will be called something else, or basically if anything changes, you should set up redirects for your old URLs so they point to the new ones."

The difference is: if you only want to use the image on the listing page, but not have it appear in the post itself, put it in the YAML header; if you want it to be used on both, then omit the YAML header and put it inline.\nThe problem is that if you do the latter, and the image is right at the start of the post (a header image, in other words), it will not render correctly if it happens to be within the range of the preview text (which doesn’t appear to be visibly configurable in Quarto, but it’s more or less the first line or two); this is because it doesn’t convert the filename path to a global path. It does in the listing itself, which is odd. You can see the result here, from one of the sample posts; the original code is:\nThis is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\n\n![](thumbnail.jpg)\nBut it we reverse it to put the image above the text:\n![](thumbnail.jpg)\n\nThis is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\nWe get this on the listing page:\n\nThis is Quarto failing to adjust the image’s pathname in the listing, though it does render the image correctly to the right as part of the listing structure.\nThis can be worked around with the simple but ugly hack of fully specifying the image’s pathname, as in:\n![](/posts/post-with-code/thumbnail.jpg)\n\nThis is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\nbut\n\nGross, and\nYou probably don’t want an inline image from the body appearing in the listing preview anyway.\n\nHopefully this issue will get resolved at some point."
