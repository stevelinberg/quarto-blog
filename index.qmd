# Steve Linberg {#title-name}

I'm a software engineer, data analyst and systems/network admin, recently wrapping up my masters work in the [Data Analytics and Computational Social Science](https://www.umass.edu/sbs/data-analytics-and-computational-social-science-program/ms) (DACSS) program at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/).

This site contains my [blog](blog.qmd), selections of my academic work, contact information, and whatever other nuggets and tidbits pop up.
