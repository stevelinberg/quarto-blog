I thought this was pretty funny... some spam tonight that *this website's database has been hacked*, and I better pay up some bitcoin or they'll `destr0y [my] site's reputati0n`! Oh noes!

It takes some doing to hack the database of a site that [doesn't have a database](https://quarto.org), let me tell you. Very impressive work guys! They must have fprotted my tarball with lunix.

Unfortunately my \$5 in free bitcoin that I got a while back is only worth about \$1.62 last time I looked. Guess they're gonna keep my database on that `0ffsh0re server`. So it goes.
