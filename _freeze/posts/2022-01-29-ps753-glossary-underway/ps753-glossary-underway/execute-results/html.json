The latter is now possible via GitHub, where the complete source for this site can be found (hit the GitHub icon in the menu in the top right).\n\nThe [glossary](../../academics/ps753-glossary/) for [PS753, Political and Social Networks](../../academics/ps753), is underway with terms from week 1.",
