    "text": "Appendix A: problems\nRather than interrupt the basic narrative above, let’s stack the problems we hit along the way down here.\n\nThat pesky first image\nOne of the basic concepts in blogs and blog listings is the all-important thumbnail image that is used on the listing page.\nThere are basically two ways to implement this in Quarto: either explicitly specify it with the image atrribute in the YAML section of the post’s index.qmd file:\nimage: \"image.jpg\"\nor, omit this attribute, and in that case, Quarto will use the first image it finds in the post body (if any). The difference is: if you only want to use the image on the listing page, but not have it appear in the post itself, put it in the YAML header; if you want it to be used on both, then omit the YAML header and put it inline.\nThe problem is that if you do the latter, and the image is right at the start of the post (a header image, in other words), it will not render correctly if it happens to be within the range of the preview text (which doesn’t appear to be visibly configurable in Quarto, but it’s more or less the first line or two); this is because it doesn’t convert the filename path to a global path. It does in the listing itself, which is odd. You can see the result here, from one of the sample posts; the original code is:\nThis is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\n\n![](thumbnail.jpg)\nBut it we reverse it to put the image above the text:\n![](thumbnail.jpg)\n\nThis is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\nWe get this on the listing page:\n\nThis is Quarto failing to adjust the image’s pathname in the listing, though it does render the image correctly to the right as part of the listing structure.\nThis can be worked around with the simple but ugly hack of fully specifying the image’s pathname, as in:\n![](/posts/post-with-code/thumbnail.jpg)\n\nThis is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\nbut\n\nGross, and\nYou probably don’t want an inline image from the body appearing in the listing preview anyway.\n\nHopefully this issue will get resolved at some point."

    "text": "Creating a (this) blog post\nSo one immediate difference in terms of workflow is that the Quarto CLI doesn’t have - as of version 1.1.251, anyway - commands for creating blog post files. In Distill, you would say create_post(\"Foo\") in the RStudio console, and that would create a skeleton with some base infrastructure, some automatic date-fu, etc. It would be easy enough to build a quick utility for doing this, but I kind of like that a blog post appears to just be a file (OK, a directory with an index.qmd file) inside the top-level posts directory.\nSo I’m going to save this file in the path posts/2022-10-01_distill_to_quarto_part_1/index.qmd, and that’s all that’s needed to make it a blog post. Yes, I’m typing out the date and title by hand, which is slightly more tedious than Distill, but I also know there’s nothing special going on under the hood when I add this file.\nWhy name the folder …distill_to_quarto_part_1 instead of just distill_to_quarto? Because I’m pretty sure I read somewhere that there’s a context where blog post titles can be disambiguated from their date prefixes, and so I want the title to be unique enough to withstand that if I add another similarly-titled post in the future. Not feeling super confident about this decision so far, but there it is.\n(See That pesky first image in Appendix A below for the first snag: the first, or “listing”, image, and a pathname problem in Quarto.)"

The document’s title is rendered as the h1 tag above the body, but you need to have at least one h2 tag for the table of contents to appear.\nTo make this work in the posts directory (or presumably any directory), it needs to be specified in the directory’s _metadata.yml file (so in this case, posts/_metadata.yml) like this:\n# Default for table of contents\ntoc: true\ntoc-title: Table of contents\ntoc-location: left\nI believe that was there by default; it could be moved over to the right if you wanted something else in the left margin, like a site directory or something.\n\nGithub links\nAt least in the default configuration, this is also where your github links configured for this specific page will appear. Unfortunately, that means they won’t appear if your document lacks h2 tags, and consequently the table of contents isn’t built. I’d prefer to have these links appear regardless, and separate from the table of contents; putting that on my mental list of things to figure out."

Nice that there’s nothing else to that.\n(Doing this did appear to confuse RStudio the next time I saved this file, though, and caused a new render process to start, stranding the prior preview tab in my browser and opening a new one. Still a few early-launch kinks to work out here, unsurprisingly…)\nPS. WHOA! that image is way too big. Let’s scale it down. Change the … do we still call this snippet rmarkdown? … from this:\n![](delete-posts.png)\nto this:\n![](delete-posts.png){width=50%}\n\nThat’s better. That was a screengrab from a high-res display, so downscaling it by 50% was the right approach."
