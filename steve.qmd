## Bio

In summer 2022, I completed coursework for the [Data Analytics and Computational Social Science (DACSS) Masters program](https://www.umass.edu/sbs/data-analytics-and-computational-social-science-program) at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://umass.edu) (formally graduating later this year). My present position is Senior Systems and Analytics Engineer at the [Gandara Center](https://www.gandaracenter.org/) in West Springfield, MA.

I've worn many IT hats over the years - sysadmin, DBA, trainer, tech writer - but a day without code is a strange and sad day.
