## Week 1 - Introduction

### Class lecture 1a: [Nodes, Edges and Network Samples](https://www.loom.com/share/efc5252bb75b463481b93e55be6e4d67)

(Note: some terms overlap somewhat or have context-dependent synonyms.)

node / vertex
: a junction in a network where two or more lines (edges) intersect; a dot connecting lines. 

tie / edge / link / relation
: lines connecting nodes, which indicate some sort of connection or relationship.

node / ego / actor
: $i$ - the node being discussed or focused on; also note "Actors are described by their relations, not by their attributes."^[@hanneman]

alter
: $j$ - the node that $i$ connects to

network population
: $n$ - the size of the population or count of nodes

With set notation, we define $i$ as a set of $n$ elements:
$$i \in 1, 2, 3 \dots n$$

and $j$ similarly as a set of $n$ elements, except that $j$ cannot equal $i$ (a node cannot connect to itself):
$$j \in 1, 2, 3 \dots n, i \ne j$$

interaction threshold
: a measure to determine whether two entities have a sufficient connection to be considered to have a link between them

snowball sample
: an entity group formed by starting with "a focal actor or set of actors"^[@hanneman] and "rolling outwards" to its connections until all nodes or actors (in a limited set) are located, or a decision to stop is made

egocentric name generator
: a mode of building an entity group (an egocentric network) defined by connection to a single central node; like a snowball sample that doesn't expand past the first set of connections

### Class lecture 1b: [Ties and Adjacency Matrices](https://www.loom.com/share/a64c3a975e7147b9bb06bf921325bd96)

adjacency matrix
: an $n \times n$ matrix depicting connections between $n$ nodes as 0 or 1, where 1 is a connection (or vertex/edge) and 0 is the absence of one:

||A|B|C|D|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|A|-|0|1|0|
|B|0|-|1|0|
|C|1|1|-|0|
|D|0|0|0|-|

directed tie
: a relationship where $W_{i,j} \ne W_{j,i}$, as might be used to represent a transfer of resources from one node to another; graphed with arrows

symmetric tie
: a relationship where $W_{i,j} = W_{j,i}$, with no direction; graphed with lines

binary tie
: a tie where $W_{i,j}$ is 0 or 1, as in the example above, indicating the absence or presence of a tie (also *dichotomous*)

valued tie
: a tie where $W_{i,j}$ is a value $v$, indicating a weight or magnitude of the connection; may be graphed with line attributes such as weight, color, etc

Ties are symmetric or directed, and binary or valued.

### Class lecture 1c: [Edgelists](https://www.loom.com/share/9232d0ffe78d4ea4affc543bf4e353af)

edgelist
: a table indicating edges in a network, with at least "from" and "to" columns, and possibly additional columns for attributes or values

|From|To|Value|
|---|---|---
|A|B|5|
|A|E|2|
|B|A|-1|
|B|C|4|
|B|D|2|
|C|A|-4|

Edgelists are more efficient in sparse networks, as they only list actual connections rather than being a matrix of all possible connections

### @hanneman, chapter 1 (Social network data):

binary measures of relations
: undirected relations, 0 or 1 for the absence or presence of a connection

multiple-category nominal measures of relations
: directed relations with categories (like "friend, lover, business relationship, kin, or no relationship")

grouped ordinal measures of relations
: measures that reflect a level of intensity or degree; often turned into binary measures by means of a threshold or cut-off

full-rank ordinal measures of relations
: an ordering from 1 to $n$ of an actor's relations (uncommon in social networks)

interval measures of relations
: continuous measures that express the strength of connections by comparison with others, to be able to say "this tie is twice as strong as that tie"; the "most advanced" level of measurement

### @lazer2011

homophily
: the idea that individuals who are similar to one another are more likely to form ties

whole network data
: relational information about a whole set (or subset) of data, with all of the actors' relations to each other considered

egocentric data
: relational information about a set of nodes connected to one particular node and not to each other

diameter
: the maximum degree of separation between any two nodes in the network

one-mode data
: ties among one set (or category) of agent, such as nations in the context of trade

two-mode data / bipartite data
: ties between different sets (or categories) of agents, such as ties between nations and international organizations; a network split into two parts, each of whose nodes only connect to nodes in the opposite part, not to nodes within its own part; "affiliation network" in @wassermanSocialNetworkAnalysis1994

### @borgatti2009

sociometry
: "a technique for eliciting and graphically representing individuals' subjective feelings toward one another"

strength of weak ties (SWT) theory
: the theory that one is likelier to hear new information from people they aren't closely connected to in a network (c.f. homiphily)

centrality
: a family of positional properties of nodes in a network

Freeman's betweenness
: a type of centrality where a node is frequently along the shortest path between pairs of nodes, giving control over flow or power

opportunity-based antecedents
: "the likelihood that two nodes will come into contact" - when considering the formation of ties

benefit-based antecedents
: "some kind of utility maximization or discomfort minimization that leads to tie formation"

node homogeneity
: a category of node outcomes referring to the similarity of nodes

performance
: a category of node outcomes referring to some good (such as strong performance)

## Week 2 - Network Structure

### Class lecture 2a: [Network Structure - Walks, Paths, and Distance](https://www.loom.com/share/a8a7949244f04ed5995d572340c20aa0)

Connections between nodes:

adjacent
: a direct connection between nodes; not necessarily bilateral in directed networks. A leading to B ("A adj B") does not mean that B leads to A ("B adj A)

reachable
: whether a node is reachable from another node, regardless of distance

distance
: the number of ties (steps, edges) that must be traversed to reach a target node

walk
: sequence (not *path*, see below) that connects two nodes, consisting of the nodes and edges

trail
: a walk that can only go through each edge / tie once, but can hit the same node more than once

path
: a trail that only hits each node and edge once; the start and end node may be the same

geodesic distance
: the shortest path between two nodes; by definition, not a trail or walk because repeated segments wouldn't be the shortest; with binary data, the number of edges between the nodes; with weighted data, might be a sum or some other calculation of "effort"

### Class lecture 2b: [Graph Substructures and Components](https://www.loom.com/share/515068ae6dc641be984c0ef974fb8e52)

Network substructures

dyad, triad, clique
: two, three, or four-or-more connected nodes

complete graph
: a network where every node is directly connected to every other node

connected graph
: a network where every node is indirectly connected to every other node

unconnected graph
: a network where at least one node is unreachable

component
: the set of all points that constitutes a connected subgraph within a network

main component
: the largest component within a network

minor component
: a smaller one, possibly one of many

pendant
: a node with only one link or edge to a network, "dangling"

isolate
: an unconnected node

### Class lecture 2c: [Dyad and Triad Census](https://www.loom.com/share/96aaf1d2982d427c83564c338d2e0b83)

mutual dyad
: a dyad where both nodes connect to each other, as in an undirected network

asymmetric dyad
: a dyad (in a directed network) where one node connects to another, but non-reciprocally (one way only)

null
: a dyad of two unconnected nodes

(empty / one edge / two path / triangle) triad
: a triad with zero, one, two or three edges between three nodes (all four possible permutations)

balance theory
: the theory that two nodes connected to a common node will also develop connections to each other

global transitivity index
: the proportion of triads in a network that are complete (with 3 connections between them)

There is a vocabulary for triads in directed networks describing the 16 possible permutations of ties (or the absence thereof) among 3 nodes, counting the number of mutual, asymmetric and null dyads, with direction indicators, like `003` or `120D` - see the slide at 3:45

vacuously transitive triad
: a triad where (to be continued...) (5 of 16 possibilities)

intransitive triad
: a triad where (to be continued...) (7 of 16 possibilities)

transitive triad
: a triad where (to be continued...) (4 of 16 possibilities)

(See @alhazmiUnderstandingSocialEffects2015)

### Class lecture 2d: [Transitivity and Clustering Coefficient](https://www.loom.com/share/ff29331e900741dd8634d921e4abafdc)

local transitivity / local clustering coefficient
: the likelihood that the neighbors of a node are also connected to each other; the number of connections that *do* exist over the number of connections that *could* exist

![](homer.png)

In the example above, there are 8 nodes that Homer (center) could connect to; among those 8 nodes, there are $7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28$ possible undirected connections (not connecting to Homer), and 9 of those 28 do exist, for a local clustering coefficient of $9/28 \approx 0.32$.

average clustering coefficient
: the average of the local clustering coefficient of all nodes in the network

## Week 3 - Network Degree

### Class lecture 3a: [Degree](https://www.loom.com/share/49273add09ce4b26924b7f5ab2983810)

(vertex) degree
: the number of links that a node has; the number of nodes it's connected to

degree distribution
: a distribution showing the number of nodes of a network that have each degree level

indegree
: the number of links that a node *receives* in a directed network

outdegree
: the number of links that a node *sends* in a directed network

### Class lecture 3b: [Centrality vs. Centralization](https://www.loom.com/share/d2ed1cbb9bc84d27adfbb3febedfeac4)

centrality
: a measure of the prominence of one node relative to others; can be variously defined

(degree) centrality
: proportional the the number of other nodes to which a node is linked

centralization
: a property of a graph or network, referring to its overall cohesion; comparing most central point to all other points; ratio of the actual sum of differences to the maximum possible sum of differences

### Class lecture 3c: [Network Density](https://www.loom.com/share/6e43e1fca3d44e1881f1a1d4895c26d3)

network density
: number of ties as a proportion of the maximum possible number of ties; varies from 0 to 1, calculation will vary by whether network is undirected or directed (twice as many potential connections)

## Week 4 - Status & Eigenvectors

### Class lecture 4a: [Status and Hierarchy](https://www.loom.com/share/91c521e65705482cb7249140be3b0274)

closeness centrality
: the sum of geodesic distances (shortest paths) to all other points in the graph. Divide by $n-1$, then invert. A measure of how close a node is to all of the other nodes in the network.

### Class lecture 4b: [Status and Prestige](https://www.loom.com/share/e0484b4af1bb4d3b8242715c8cba30f8)

prestige
: signal of the quality of a node, of a node's visibility within the network

eigenvector centrality
: "takes into account the centrality of other nodes to which a node is connected. That is, being connected to other central nodes increases centrality." Takes into account the centrality of the nodes a node is connected to, considering the importance of the connected nodes and not just their quantity or path length. A node with high eigenvector centrality is connected to significant numbers of other highly central nodes.
$$\lambda \text{c} = \text{Wc}$$

Bonacich Power
: "A closely related concept, but includes a weighting factor that emphasizes global vs. local structure (and negative connections)" In contrast to eigenvector centrality, penalizes nodes connected to other well-connected nodes, under the theory that being connected to strong or powerful nodes means a node has less influence and power than it would if it were connected to fewer or weaker nodes.
$$\text{c}(\alpha, \beta) = \alpha(\text{I} - \beta\text{W})^{-1}\text{W1}$$

### Class lecture 4c: [Hubs and Bridges](https://www.loom.com/share/e85fa1918f70438e9bb67232ade95594)

bridge
: a node with few ties to central actors

hub
: a node with many ties to peripheral actors

reflected centrality
: the degree of centrality that a node receives from a connected node that is due to that node's centrality. If A has influential friend B, then A's eigenvector centrality will be higher; reflected centrality is the portion of A's centrality that comes from B's centrality.

derived centrality
: the remainder of the eigenvector centrality that A receives from B in the example above, that is not due to B's centrality but just from B being a connected node

Reflected and derived centrality can be represented in the following matrix by Mizruchi et al:

||High reflected centrality|Low reflected centrality|
|---|---|---|
|High derived centrality|Cosmopolitans|Pure bridges|
|Low derived centrality|Pure hubs|Peripherals|

The four prototypes are:

cosmopolitans
: well-connected nodes that are connected to other well-connected nodes; the "cool kids" table

pure hubs
: well-connected nodes that are connected to nodes that are not well-connected; the cool kid who talks to uncool kids

pure bridge
: a node connected to few but high-centrality nodes; a friend of the cool kid with few other friends

peripheral
: a node with few and low-centrality connections; me and my D&D nerd friends in high school

### Class lecture 4d: [Status and Core/Periphery Networks](https://www.loom.com/share/2b5fdf986b164bb785a4c8c0fca0d1e9)


betweenness centrality
: a count of the number of shortest paths between nodes that pass through another node
